$CMP AD831
D A low distortion, wide dynamic range, monolithic mixer for use in such applications as RF to IF down conversion in HF and VHF receivers, the second mixer in DMR base stations, direct-to-baseband conversion, quadrature modulation and demodulation, and doppler-shift detection in ultrasound imaging applications. The mixer includes an LO driver and a low-noise output amplifier and provides both user-programmable power consumption and 3rd-order intercept point.
