## :warning: Deprecation warning
In preparation for the KiCad v6 release this repository will be locked down on 2020-09.01. No new pull-requests will be accepted. Existing pull-requests can be worked on until 2020-10-01. Changes breaking v5.1 compatibility can be merged starting 2020-09-01.

On 2020-10-01 this repository, including issues and pull requests, will be archived and transferred to gitlab.com. In order for the gitlab importer to function properly it is recommend you set your emailaddress on github to public and use the same address for your gitlab account. Otherwise the importer can't correlate the account information and the issues/comments on gitlab will be owned by `kicad-bot`.

We plan to convert the library to the new v6 S-expr format after it is imported to gitlab. That also means that old pull requests will need to be redone with v6 format if they are not merged until then.
