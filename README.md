# KiCad Symbols

This repository *will be* where KiCad symbol libraries are stored.

Currently the symbol libraries are located in the [kicad-library](https://github.com/kicad/kicad-library) repository, however they are mixed in with 3D models and project templates.

These libraries are going to be separated - this repository serves as a placeholder for the symbol libs.
